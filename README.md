# Intelligent Loan Approval System using Machine Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
A mid-sized financial company provides personal and home loans to customers across urban and rural regions of India.  
Currently, loan approvals are done manually by loan officers who verify:

- Income proofs  
- Employment details  
- Credit history  
- Other financial documents  

This manual process is:
- ⏳ Time-consuming  
- ⚠️ Biased and inconsistent  
- ❌ Leads to rejection of good customers  
- 💸 Approves some high-risk applicants  

To solve this, the company wants an **AI-powered loan approval system** that can automatically analyze applicant data and predict whether a loan should be:

✅ Approved  
❌ Rejected  

before final human verification.
